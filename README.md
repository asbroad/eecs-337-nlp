### EECS 337 - Project 1

There are 3 different aspects of this project (all run with Python 2.7 from the project\_01/src/ directory)


 1. The main project which will run and output a .json file to be used in the autograder
      * To run (from the src folder) : 'python main.py'.
      * This file has two parameters that need to be set inside the main.py file, at the top of the file there are 'year' and 'save_filename' strings.  The year can take the value '2013' or '2015' both must be strings.  save_filename can take any name you want and will save the .json file with that name.
 2. The GUI
      * To run (from the src folder) : 'python GUI.py'
      * When it loads up, you will first have to select a year (2013 or 2015). Then you can select an award and press the 'Go' button.
 3. The fun stuff
      * To run (from the src folder) : 'python fun_thing.py'
      * It will ask you for a name, enter the name of an actor/actress that you enjoy and watch it do it's magic!

### EECS 337 - Project 2

For the second project, we used Python 2.7

For non-standard packages, we only used NLTK.  There are a number of easy ways to install this package depending on your OS. [This site](http://www.nltk.org/install.html) explains the options well.
